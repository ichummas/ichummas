      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Nestled in the lush heart of Wayanad, Ichumma’s Inn began its journey in 2017 as a dream project by the award-winning 
        <a href="https://hummingtree.com" target="_blank" class="text-teal-600 underline hover:text-teal-800">Humming Tree Architects</a>. 
        What started as a weekend home soon transformed into a warm and welcoming homestay — a space where comfort, privacy, and nature come together beautifully.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Unlike traditional stays, Ichumma’s Inn offers you something truly rare — complete privacy. As a single-house property, the entire space is reserved for just one group at a time. No shared walls, no unfamiliar faces — just you, your loved ones, and the peace of Wayanad’s green hills.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Our homestay is equipped with everything to make your stay memorable — a serene swimming pool, a full-sized basketball court, a cozy barbeque setup, and nights warmed by the glow of a campfire. Whether you’re looking to unwind or play, there’s something for everyone here.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And of course, no stay in Kerala is complete without its flavors. Our attentive staff are just a call away, ready to serve up delicious Kerala cuisine and offer help whenever you need it — while still giving you the privacy you value.
